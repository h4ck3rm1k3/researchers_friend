    conclusional data from lower level assertions, so that all
    assertions can be tracked through layers of reasoning back to their
    original evidential statement forms.  Assertions should not be
    deleted, but an attribute (Disproved) exists to nullify erroneous
    conclusions so that the erroneous reasoning can be preserved and
    marked as believed to be no longer valid.  Everyone's work has
    value, even if it is later proved to be wrong.  Since all assertions
    are tagged according to their origin, it is possible to store
    other's assertions as well and identify that data as such.  While
    most assertions are tied to particular SOURCE excerpts (the Content
    attribute in REPRESENTATION) or previous assertions, an assertion
    can apply to an entire SOURCE.

            EVENT-TYPE-ROLE (through the Value attribute).
        Each ASSERTION depends on zero to one SURETY-SCHEME-PARTs.
        Each ASSERTION is the direct output of no more than one SOURCE.
            Some ASSERTIONs are not the direct output of any SOURCE, but
            are the output of one to many other ASSERTIONs (through
            ASSERTION-ASSERTION); note that many lower level ASSERTIONs
            are coupled to one higher level ASSERTION by pairing one at

            sure the researcher is of this particular assertion.

            can be the researcher, or a compiler from which the
            researcher obtained data.  In group projects, there may be
            many researchers.
        source -- (foreign key) A pointer to the source that gave rise
            to this assertion, if the assertion is the result of a
            direct source and not another assertion.

        subject2 -- A pointer to the appropriate PERSONA, EVENT,
            CHARACTERISTIC, or GROUP attribute of ID.
        value_role -- If the statement is of the appropriate type, the
            value of the object in the statement.  Example:  (hair
            color) red; (occupation) teamster; (sex) female.  In some
            instances, value can be thought of as "Role" such as "Groom"
            or "Witness".
        rationale -- Narrative that explains the researcher's basis for
            the assertion.  This can be curt for simple or trivial
            assertions, or very extensive if necessary for more complex
            assertions created from a variety of conflicting sources.
        disproved -- A yes/no indicator that the genealogist no longer
            believes the assertion to be true.  "Yes" or "true" means it
